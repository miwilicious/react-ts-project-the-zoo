# react-ts-project-the-zoo
Built a React (TypeScript) SPA fetching animal data from an API, stored locally. Users view animal details, mark animals fed with timers resetting after 3 hours, and receive notifications after 4 hours. Includes graceful error handling for broken images and modular service/component structure.
